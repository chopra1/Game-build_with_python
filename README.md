Create a Game Using Classes and Objects

For this project, we want you to create a fully functional system that involves multiple classes. Weâ€™ll give more details on the specific requirements below.

Create a Pokemon-like game where your Classes could be different types of Creatures that can battle each other. You could create a system where you have a Trainer class that has multiple Creatures. You could create Items to use on those Creatures.
